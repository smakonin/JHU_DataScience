Tidy Data - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The **run_analysis.R** script will convert the [UCI HAR dataset] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) (see [description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)) to a 1-file tidy dataset of mean and standard standard deviation measurements. The average of each measurement variable for each activity and each subject is calculated. The resulting file is stored in the current workspace. The original dataset must also be unzip and present in your working directory for this script to execute successfully. See **CodeBook.md** for a description of the resulting dataset file *UCIHARtidy.txt*.
